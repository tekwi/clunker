Market Opportunity
Total Addressable Market (TAM): $32 billion annually
Serviceable Available Market (SAM): $4.7 billion annually
Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $341 million annually
(Assumptions: 25,000 fleet locations x $13,656 Average Revenue per Account)

The Problem
Trucking companies lose billions each year due to uncollected accessorial fees. An estimated $11 billion is lost annually due to detention-related (one of the accessorial fees) productivity and safety events. Efficient tracking and documentation are significant challenges, with:
50% of detention claims are unpaid.
70% of fleets not consistently invoicing detention fees.

Business Model
Our revenue model includes subscription tiers for fleets:
WIN: $999/month + 4% of recovered revenue for 200+ trucks.
GROW: $499/month + 4% for 50+ trucks.
START: $299/month + 4% for 10-50 trucks.

Go-To-Market Strategy
Leverage existing connections in the fleet industry.
Launch campaigns for lead generation.
Soft launch product in September 2025, with ongoing marketing and partnerships to expand services.

Our Growth Engine
DockChronâ€™s growth strategy leverages industry partnerships, targeted marketing campaigns, and valuable user feedback to iterate on product features. Our growth trajectory will focus on:
Expanding our user base through referral programs and success stories.
Enhancing product visibility via industry events and targeted online advertising.
Building strategic relationships with telematics and TMS providers and transportation associations to create a network effect.

Our Defensible Moat
DockChron is uniquely positioned in the market with several defensive barriers to entry, including:
Proprietary Technology: Our AI-driven algorithms for fee recovery provide a competitive edge.
Data Network Effects: As more users tap into our system, we gain valuable insights and data that improve our service and create high barriers for competitors.
Customer Loyalty: By delivering consistent value and improving fee collection processes, we build long-term relationships with customers that are hard for new entrants to disrupt.

Achieved MVP launch with strong user demand.
Targets: 1000 paid users and $1.5 million ARR within the next 12 months.
Plans to integrate more Electronic Logging Device (ELD) vendors and expand features.
