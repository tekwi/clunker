What is cash for cars?
Cash for cars is a service that offers to purchase used cars from owners in exchange for cash or check payment on the spot. This option is beneficial for those who want to quickly and easily get rid of their car without the hassle and time involved in private sales.

One of the best parts about cash for cars is that it saves you from all of the headaches associated with selling a car privately, such as having to advertise for potential buyers, dealing with haggling over prices, and worrying about meeting up with strangers. Cash for cars also makes it easy and convenient to sell your car because they come directly to you at your location, provide you with paperwork assistance, and tow away your car free of charge.

In Dallas specifically, one of the primary benefits of using a cash for cars service is that you don’t have to worry about running around in search of potential buyers. You’ll receive an instant guaranteed offer from cash for cars which allows you to get rid of your car quickly without having to pay dealer fees or wait months until your vehicle sells.

How does it work?
The Clunker Junker’s Cash for Cars program in Dallas is a simple, hassle-free way to sell your vehicle. The process begins with you entering the details of your vehicle online or over the phone. We will then provide you with an instant offer for your car. If you accept the offer, we will arrange for a tow truck to pick up your vehicle from your location.

At the time of pickup, you’ll need to provide the keys and title documents, and the driver will provide payment. Our carriers are highly experienced professionals who have been trained in vehicle transportation. You can be sure that your car will be handled with care and respect throughout its journey. Plus, all tows are free of charge!

After your car has been picked up, you’ll need to notify the DMV that the vehicle was sold. This will help keep your records up-to-date and ensure that any remaining liens on the car are released. With The Clunker Junker’s Cash for Cars Program in Dallas, it has never been easier to sell your unwanted vehicle!

Eric's Expert Take
Eric is our founder and CEO and has nearly 15 years of experience buying and selling used and junk cars in Dallas, TX. He is also a data nerd with a finger on the pulse of the cash for cars industry and salvage vehicle values.

Hey, I’m Eric Mitz, founder of The Clunker Junker. Over the past month in Dallas, we’ve been paying an average of $895 for vehicles. For example, if you’re driving a compact car like a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, offers are averaging $806. Pickup trucks such as the Ford F-150 or Chevrolet Silverado are at the top, with average payouts of $1,189. SUVs and crossovers like the Toyota RAV4 or Ford Escape are getting about $1,055.
We’ve recently bought about 2,377 cars in Dallas, sending out over $2,000,000 in payments. The most common vehicle we’ve picked up is the Nissan Altima, a mid-size sedan. Issues like transmission failures, faulty catalytic converters, and electrical problems are pretty common with the Altima. In many cases, selling can make more sense than putting money into repairs that may not last.
Prices for used and junk cars in Dallas are holding steady, with only a slight month-to-month change of about -1.0%. Compared to last year, things haven't moved much. The stable market means it’s a good time to sell if you’re thinking about it. I’ll be watching the trends and will share any major updates as they come up.
