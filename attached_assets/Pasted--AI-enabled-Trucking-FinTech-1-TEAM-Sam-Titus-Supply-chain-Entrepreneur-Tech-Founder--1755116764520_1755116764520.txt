   An estimated $11 billion dollars is lost annually due to just detention related productivity and safety events

 ANCILLARY FEES ARE RARELY COLLECTED
      Hard to Track
50% of Detention claims are
unpaid due to inefficient tracking and documentation
Billed Inconsistently 70% of fleets do not consistently
invoice detention fees
Time Consuming
Tracking details, disputing claims, and chasing payments can outweigh the cost of the ancillary fees

  WHY NOW?
Fleets are motivated.. With fuel, labor, and equipment expenses climbing, margins are thin and uncollected ancillary fees are an increasingly painful loss.
Consistent data and AI are available. Advances in AI models and legally required electronic logging devices (ELDs) provide consistent data and capabilities to predict, track and collect ancillary fees.
Regulations are becoming more stringent. New regulations are requiring greater transparency & accountability in supply chain operations.
